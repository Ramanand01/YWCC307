Hello My Name is Ramanand Kachhia. I have chose 6G as my presentation for this class. 
6G is the next generation network technology. 6G will came out around year 2030. 
Rencently we han an issue with 5G network with flight communucation for their landing so that can be similar with the 6G as well. 
6G will be 100x faster then 5G that we are currently using.
